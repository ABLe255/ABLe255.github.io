        <div class="para1"> If had to describe myself with just a few
          adjectives I would have to say: sales leader, marketing
          professional, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/software">IBM</a>
          product expert, technical operations, and analytical
          competence. As a candidate with over 20 years of professional
          high-value IBM business development, I have distinguished
          myself above other candidates by my unrelenting focus on
          client service, and commitment to increasing company profits.
          In fact, my background includes numerous awards and
          recognition.<br>

        <div class="para2"> IBM recognizes the importance of military
          service, and because of their willingness to grant me on-leave
          time, I was able to serve my country in several key areas. I
          recently returned from participation in <a
            href="https://www.eur.army.mil/AtlanticResolve/">Operation
            Atlantic Resolve</a>; a contingency operation meant to
          strengthen partnerships with our NATO allies; develop
          interoperability between multinational forces and deter
          foreign aggression in Eastern Europe. </div>
