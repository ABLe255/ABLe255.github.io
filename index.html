            If had to describe myself with just a few
            adjectives I would have to say: sales leader, marketing
            professional, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/software">IBM</a>
            product expert, technical operations, and analytical competence.
            As a candidate with over 20 years of professional high-value IBM
            business development, I have distinguished myself above other
            candidates by my unrelenting focus on client service, and
            commitment to increasing company profits. In fact, my background
            includes numerous awards and recognition.<br>

            IBM recognizes the importance of military
            service, and because of their willingness to grant me on-leave
            time, I was able to serve my country in several key areas. I
            recently returned from participation in <a href="https://www.eur.army.mil/AtlanticResolve/">Operation
                Atlantic Resolve</a>; a contingency operation meant to
            strengthen partnerships with our NATO allies; develop
            interoperability between multinational forces and deter foreign
            aggression in Eastern Europe.
